      "summary": "Existing law establishes within the state disability insurance program a family temporary disability insurance program, also known as the Paid Family Leave program, for the provision of wage replacement benefits to workers who take time off work to care for a seriously ill family member or to bond with a minor child within one year of birth or placement, as specified, and, on and after January 1, 2021, to take time off to participate in a qualifying exigency related to the covered active duty or call to covered active duty of the individuals' spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent in the Armed Forces of the United States. Existing law defines terms for paid family leave purposes, including defining the terms \"care recipient,\" \"care provider,\" and \"family care leave.\" \n\nThis bill would revise those definitions for the purpose of the qualifying exigency provisions. The bill would define \"military member\" for the purpose of that term's use in those revised definitions. \n\nExisting law requires certain documentation of a qualifying exigency, including a copy of new active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military as required by the department if the need for leave because of a qualifying exigency arises out of a different covered active duty or call to covered active duty or notification of an impending call or order to covered active duty of the same or a different family member.\n\nThis bill would provide that the new documentation requirement would apply to a need for leave because of a qualifying exigency arising out of those described circumstances with respect to the same or a different eligible family member.

      "summary": "(1) Existing law prohibits an employer with 50 or more employees in a 75-mile radius to refuse to grant an employee a request to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for family care and medical leave if the employee worked 1,250 hours in the prior 12 months. Existing law includes within \"family care and medical leave\" the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child and the serious health condition of the employee's child, parent, or spouse.\n\nThis bill would expand the scope of those provisions to instead prohibit an employer with 5 or more employees to refuse to grant an employee a request to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for family care and medical leave if the employee had 180 days of service with the employer. The bill would expand the definition of \"family care and medical leave\" to include leave for reason of the birth or placement of a child if the employee has identified the child as their designated person, as defined, leave to care for a grandparent, grandchild, sibling, domestic partner, or designated person who has a serious health condition, and leave because of a qualifying exigency related to the covered active duty or call to covered active duty of an employee's spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent in the Armed Forces of the United States. The bill would delete a provision specifying that, if both parents are employed by the employer and are entitled to leave, the employer is not required to grant leave in connection with the birth, adoption, or foster care of a child that is greater than 12 weeks.\n\n(2) Existing law, the New Parent Leave Act, prohibits an employer with 20 or more employees in a 75-mile radius to refuse to grant an employee a request to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to bond with a new child within one year of the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of the child if the employee worked 1,250 hours in the prior 12 months.\n\nThis bill would repeal those provisions.\n\n(3) Existing law establishes within the state disability insurance program a family temporary disability insurance program, also known as the Paid Family Leave program, for the provision of wage replacement benefits to workers who take time off work to care for a seriously ill family member or to bond with a minor child within one year of birth or placement, as specified, and, on and after January 1, 2021, to take time off to participate in a qualifying exigency related to the covered active duty or call to covered active duty of the individuals' spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent in the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nThis bill would expand the scope of those provisions to include time off to care for a seriously ill designated person or child-in-law, as those terms are defined, or to bond with a designated person or child-in-law within one year of the birth or placement of the designated person or child-in-law.\n\n(4) Existing law makes an individual ineligible for family temporary disability insurance benefits on any day that another family member is ready, willing, able, and available to provide the required care or participate in the qualified exigency, as specified. Existing law authorizes an employer to require an employee to take up to 2 weeks of vacation leave before the employee receives the benefits.\n\nThis bill would delete those provisions.\n\n(5) Under existing law, workers are required to pay contributions to the Unemployment Compensation Disability Fund, a special fund in the State Treasury, and those funds are continuously appropriated for the purpose of providing disability benefits and making payment of administrative expenses.\n\nBy authorizing the expenditure of these funds for a new purpose, the bill would make an appropriation.",

      "summary": "Existing unemployment compensation disability law requires workers to pay contribution rates based on, among other things, wages received in employment and benefit disbursement, for payment into the Unemployment Compensation Disability Fund, a special fund in the State Treasury. That fund is continuously appropriated for the purpose of providing disability benefits and making payment of expenses in administering those provisions.\n\nExisting law establishes, within the state disability insurance program, a family temporary disability insurance program, also known as the paid family leave program, for the provision of wage replacement benefits for up to 6 weeks to workers who take time off work to care for a seriously ill family member or to bond with a minor child within one year of birth or placement, as specified. Existing law defines \"weekly benefit amount\" for purposes of both employee contributions and benefits under this program to mean the amount of weekly benefits available to qualifying disabled individuals pursuant to unemployment compensation disability law, calculated pursuant to specified formulas partly based on the applicable percentage of the wages paid to an individual for employment by employers during the quarter of the individual's disability base period in which these wages were highest, but not to exceed the maximum workers' compensation temporary disability indemnity weekly benefit amount established by the Department of Industrial Relations.\n\nThis bill would revise the formula for determining benefits available pursuant to the family temporary disability insurance program, for periods of disability commencing after January 1, 2020, by redefining the weekly benefit amount to be equal to 100% of the wages paid to an individual for employment by employers during the quarter of the individual's disability base period in which these wages were highest, divided by 13, but not exceeding the maximum workers' compensation temporary disability indemnity weekly benefit amount established by the Department of Industrial Relations.\n\nBy providing for the deposit of additional contributions in, and by authorizing an increase in disbursements from, the Unemployment Compensation Disability Fund, this bill would make an appropriation.",

      "summary": "Creates the Family Leave Insurance Program Act. Requires the Department of Labor to establish and administer a Family Leave Insurance Program that provides family leave insurance benefits to eligible employees who take unpaid family leave to care for a newborn child, a newly adopted or newly placed foster child, or a family member with a serious health condition.

Requires the Department of Labor to establish and administer a Family Leave Insurance Program that provides family leave insurance benefits to eligible employees who take unpaid family leave to care for a newborn child, a newly adopted or newly placed foster child, or a family member with a serious health condition. Sets forth eligibility requirements for benefits under the Act including that the employee must (i) establish that he or she has been employed for at least 680 hours in employment during the employee's qualifying year and (ii) document that he or she has provided the employer with written notice of the employee's intention to take family leave. Defines \"employer\" to mean (a) any person, partnership, corporation, association, or other business entity that employs 50 or more employees for each working day during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the year in which the leave is to be taken or in the year immediately preceding the year in which the leave is to be taken; and (b) the State of Illinois and any other unit of local government. Contains provisions concerning disqualification from benefits; premium payments; the amount and duration of benefits; the recovery of erroneous payments; hearings; defaulted premium payments; elective coverage; employment protection; coordination of family leave; defined terms; and other matters. Amends the State Finance Act. Creates the Family Leave Insurance Account Fund.",
